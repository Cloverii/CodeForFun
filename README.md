- ### Code Challenge
  My code challenge for GSoc 2017 Project Idea of 52°North [**Simple Features for protobuf and others**](https://wiki.52north.org/Projects/GSoC2017ProjectIdeas#Simple_Features_for_protobuf_and_others)

  Read a GeoJSON file, parse to an object, and encode it with [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf).


- ### Weather
  Get the weather information in the future several days.

  Use the API of [心知天气](https://www.seniverse.com). 

  Writen in Java, and use [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to convert  JSON string to Java Objects.
